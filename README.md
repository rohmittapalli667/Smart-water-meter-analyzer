# Smart Water Meter Data Analysis Project


This repository contains the code and documentation for our Smart Water Meter Data Analysis project, developed by a team of students from the Amrita School of Computing, Coimbatore. Our goal is to utilize smart water meter technology to solve water-related issues by detecting inappropriate water consumption and improving water management. 

## Problem Statement

Traditional water meters have limitations when it comes to reducing water wastage and identifying losses due to leaks, frauds, and defective meters. Our project aims to address these issues by leveraging smart water meter technology. By analyzing the collected data, we can detect anomalies and provide valuable insights for better water management.

## Features and Benefits

- Remote monitoring of water consumption and infrastructure maintenance through leak detection.
- Automatic billing and customer management for efficient water utility services.
- Battery-powered smart water meters that support system configuration and enable easy installation.
- Conservation of water resources by identifying inappropriate water consumption patterns.
- Improved accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional water meters.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for creating the user interface web page)
- **Database:** Live SQL Server & pgAdmin 4 (for storing and managing the collected data)

## Analysis and Insights

- Identification and analysis of different types of smart water meters and their specifications.
- Examination of subscriber data, including Meter ID, Subscriber ID, meter capacity, mobile number, type of residence, and address/locality.
